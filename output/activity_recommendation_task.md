**Budget Considerations:**

The initial budget breakdown significantly underestimates the accommodation cost, which is a major factor.  Securing large villas for 23 people for 100 days will likely consume a large portion of the budget.


**Note:** This itinerary prioritizes sightseeing and private experiences to maximize enjoyment. The specific costs will need further refinement with quotes from tour operators and service providers.  The extremely large budget allows for luxury and flexibility but careful planning and booking are still essential.
