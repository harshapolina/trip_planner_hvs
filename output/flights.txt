**Important Considerations:**

* **Multiple Bookings:**  Booking flights for 23 people will likely require multiple searches and potentially multiple bookings. Google Flights might have passenger limits per search. Consider using a travel agent specializing in group bookings for assistance.

* **Flight Costs:** The budget of 1,000,000,000 INR is substantial, but international flights for 23 people can be expensive.  Explore various flight aggregator websites and consider booking in advance for potentially better prices.

* **Airport Transfers:**  Factor in airport transfers from Goa airport to your chosen accommodations. For a group of 23, consider renting multiple vans or minibuses.

* **Visa Requirements:** Ensure all 23 travelers have the necessary visas for entry into India.

* **Alternative Airports:**  Check flight options from other airports in Japan besides Tokyo (Narita or Haneda) to potentially find cheaper options.


The prompt above provides a starting point for finding flight options.  Due to the large group size, utilizing a travel agent is highly recommended for efficient and cost-effective booking.
