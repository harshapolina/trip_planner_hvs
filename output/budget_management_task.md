**Goa Extravaganza: 100-Day Budget for 23 People**

**Total Budget:** 1,000,000,000 INR

**I. Accommodation (100 days):**

*   *Target:* Secure large villas/resorts accommodating 23 people comfortably.  This is the largest expense and will require contacting multiple villa rental agencies for quotes.  The initial estimate is a range, and the final cost will be determined after receiving quotes.
*   *Initial Estimate:* 400,000,000 - 500,000,000 INR (This needs confirmation after contacting agencies)

**II. Transportation:**

*   *Buses:*  Assume renting multiple buses for longer trips.  Based on online searches, the daily cost of a large bus rental in Goa can range significantly.  Further research is required to determine the most cost effective option.
*   *Private Cars:*  A few private cars for flexibility and shorter trips.
*   *Local Transport:* Taxis and ferries for shorter distances.
*   *Initial Estimate:* 100,000,000 - 150,000,000 INR (Requires more detailed research on bus rental rates and car hire)

**III. Food & Catering:**

*   *Self-Catering:* Utilize villa kitchens for some meals.
*   *Dining Out:*  A mix of local restaurants and beach shacks.
*   *Dedicated Chef (Optional):*  Consider hiring a chef for some meals to reduce costs and maintain quality (This is a significant cost and needs to be factored separately).
*   *Average Food Cost per Person/Day:*  Assume a mid-range cost of 1000 INR per person per day (This could be lower if significant self-catering is done. If a chef is hired this needs to be factored separately).  This is a rough estimate that may need adjustments.
*   *Total Food Cost:* (1000 INR/person/day) * (23 people) * (100 days) = 2,300,000 INR
*   *Initial Estimate (including potential chef):* 200,000,000 - 250,000,000 INR (Requires a more detailed breakdown based on chefâ€™s fees, grocery costs and dining out)

**IV. Activities & Excursions:**

*   Water sports, sightseeing, cultural experiences, boat trips, spice plantation tours, wildlife sanctuary visits, etc.
*   *Initial Estimate:* 150,000,000 INR (This needs a detailed breakdown of costs for each activity.  Prices can vary significantly between activities).

**V. Contingency Fund:**

*   *Initial Estimate:* 50,000,000 INR (To cover unexpected expenses, price increases, and unforeseen circumstances)

**VI. Total Estimated Budget Breakdown:**
