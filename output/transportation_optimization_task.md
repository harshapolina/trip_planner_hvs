**Goa Extravaganza: 100-Day Transportation Plan for 23 People**

**Budget:** 100,000,000 INR (This is an initial estimate; the actual cost will depend on the quotes received from transportation providers)

**I. Long-Distance Travel (Buses):**

*   **Requirement:**  Multiple large buses (capacity of at least 23 passengers) will be necessary for traveling between different regions of Goa and for longer excursions.  The exact number of buses and the required number of days will depend on the itinerary.
*   **Action:** Contact multiple bus rental companies (identified in the initial search results) for quotes based on various scenarios (e.g., daily rental, weekly rental, etc.) to find the most cost-effective option. Specify the need for 23 passengers, and include any additional costs like driver fees, permits, insurance, and potential fuel surcharges.
*   **Estimated Cost:**  This will be determined after contacting rental agencies. Consider potential cost savings from negotiating rates for long-term rentals.

**II. Short-Distance Travel & Flexibility (Private Cars):**

*   **Requirement:**  Several private cars (e.g., 3-4 SUVs) are needed for greater flexibility in shorter trips, allowing smaller groups to explore independently.
*   **Action:** Similar to the bus rentals, contact car rental companies to get quotes for daily, weekly, or monthly rentals of SUVs, considering the entire 100-day duration.
*   **Estimated Cost:** Determined after getting quotes. Consider potential discounts on longer rentals.

**III. Local Transportation (Taxis & Ferries):**

*   **Taxis:** For shorter distances within towns and cities, taxis will be used.  Costs will vary depending on the distance and negotiate rates.
*   **Ferries:** Ferries will be used for island hopping and other water crossings.  The exact cost will depend on specific ferry routes and schedules.
*   **Action:** Research ferry schedules and fares for the planned island trips and other ferry routes. Research taxi rates from online sources and prepare for potential on-the-spot negotiations.
*   **Estimated Cost:**  An initial estimate for taxis and ferries is 10,000,000 INR (this requires more specific calculations based on research).

**IV. Detailed Cost Breakdown & Contingency:**

*   After receiving quotes from bus and car rental companies, create a detailed breakdown of the transportation costs, considering daily rentals versus weekly rentals.  
*   Include the estimated cost of taxis and ferries.
*   Allocate a contingency fund (at least 10% of the total transportation cost) to handle unexpected situations, price increases, or last-minute changes.


**V. Recommendations:**

*   Contact at least three bus rental companies and three car rental agencies to compare prices.
*   Negotiate for longer rental periods (weekly or monthly) to reduce the overall cost.
*   Book transportation in advance, especially during peak season, to secure better rates and availability.
*   Maintain detailed records of all transportation expenses during the trip.


This transportation plan provides a framework for managing travel during the Goa extravaganza.  The actual cost will be finalized only after receiving quotes from the various providers. The 100,000,000 INR budget should provide ample flexibility, but careful cost management and booking strategies will help to ensure optimal value.
